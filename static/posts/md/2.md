## The Idea

It came when I was in school and my teacher told us that there is an dictation tomorrow in 20 words, so when I went home I started memorizing them with various ways, I thought I memorized them, so I went to my mother and told her if she can dictate me these words, but unfortunately she was busy.

And in that moment, it popped in my head, Why dont I make an App that dictates you with Text To Speech Tech?

I did some research an I found that package: `flutter_tts`, It lets you convert text into speech in the Flutter Framework.
I designed my app and implemented the functionality, and it worked perfectly.
I then made a website for it using Google Sites (I didn't want to spend more time on the project and I needed something quick).
And I wrote a Documentation of the app, for how to use it.

Then I open sourced the app on github:
