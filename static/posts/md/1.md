# My Python GUI YouTube Video Downloader

This is a project I made in my old School (Sharjah Private School) in grade 6, it is basicly a GUI program made with GUI framework called QT.

This program helps you download YouTube videos in a video or audio format.
It uses `pytube` under the hood to download the videos.

I made this program for a competition my school told me about, and guess what...

I won the first place.

I mean the competition wasn't hard at all, the other students were making cli calculator programs :)
