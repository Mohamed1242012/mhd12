## üöÄ Inspiration
How many times have I wanted to learn something but couldn't find a teacher who fits my learning style?
Probably a lot of times!
That's why I introduce AI Courses.
## üí° What it does
AI Courses is a web app that helps you create your own learning path and choose your favorite style. You start by inputting some data in the home screen and after 10 seconds you have a fully optimized learning path combined with an AI powered teacher that you can chat with all day long, available 24/7 and the best part is that all of that comes at the price of ü•Åü•Åü•Å _**FREE**_.


## üõ†Ô∏è  How I built it
In the beginning I wondered:
> What Database should I build my project with?

and I chose PostgreSQL because it's now the leading database in the tech stack (to be honest it's also the only SQL database I learned).
 
Then I started brainstorming about the database structure, so I grabbed a piece of paper and started drawing the relations and tables that I will need, Then I did some _**SQL Magic**_ to create the tables, Then I started working on the backend and the API of my website, I used `psycopg2` and it is the driver of the PostgreSQL database in Python, and I used it to make a REST API.
<div class="ai-courses-video" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; width: 360px; max-width: 100%;">

<iframe width="450" height="203" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hoGeZfSmPP4?si=yBsUwhK5umgCruQv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen style="max-width: 100%;"></iframe>

</div>

<style>
@media (max-width: 1065px) {
    .ai-courses-video {
        float: none !important;
        margin: 20px 0 !important;
        width: 100% !important;
        max-width: 100% !important;
    }
    .ai-courses-video iframe {
        width: 100% !important;
        height: 203px !important;
        max-width: 100% !important;
    }
}
</style>

I also made the AI have memory by storing important information user mentions in a table in the database.

Then I started working on the hardest and the longest task, its frontend.
I used a CSS framework called Bootstrap to speed up the process, then I worked on the main two Pages `Home` and `Chat`.
I wrote some JavaScript to send requests to the server with the Fetch API, and finished the chat section.

Now my favorite part: Deployment on my [server](/blog/id/).

<div class="server-img-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; width: 360px; max-width: 100%;">
    <img src="/static/posts/img/server.jpg" alt="IMG OF SERVER" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;">
</div>

<style>
@media (max-width: 1065px) {
        .server-img-left {
                float: none !important;
                margin: 20px 0 !important;
                width: 100% !important;
                max-width: 100% !important;
        }
}
</style>

I started by doing a quick ssh into the server and git cloning the files, then I started making two files, `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml`.
Those are the files that tell Docker how to start the project.

Then I fired up the containers and had some problems I will tell you about in the next section.
But after some toubleshooting it worked.

Then I shooted some bullets into my firewall to open some ports, and that's it!

## ‚ö° Challenges I ran into
In the deployment process I had some issues in Docker while configuring ports, I had some errors in my app because the URL of the PostgreSQL wasn't working, I didnt know why it didn't work but later I discovered that Docker networks are separate from the normal network in the server, and thats why when you type `ip a` in the terminal while some Docker Containers are running you will see some things related to docker as if they were network devices.
So I fixed the issue and went on with my life :)

</div>

<style>
@media (max-width: 1065px) {
    .ai-courses-img-right {
        float: none !important;
        margin: 20px 0 !important;
        width: 100% !important;
        max-width: 100% !important;
    }
}

## üèÖ Accomplishments that I am proud of

I am so happy that I made such a great website in one and a half days, and that I have met some great people who are around my age with great skills.

## üìö What I learned

I learned a lot of things while making this project and one of the most important things is SQL, I think that this was a great learning experience to learn something new for me like SQL and do real world applications with it.

Something else I learned was making APIs and using json to make programming languages communicate with each other.

## üöÄ What's next for AI Courses

I think that this is just the beginning of a big project or even a startup with millions of users, and that this will help people learn new skills and have more knowledge.
